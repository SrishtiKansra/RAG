# 🛡️ RAG Misinformation Robustness Tester (P5: *In RAG We Trust?*)

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project for a university NLP course. It answers questions and verifies claims from a knowledge base, then tests how easily the system is fooled by injected fake ("poisoned") documents, and whether a verification prompt makes it more robust.

It evaluates three datasets behind one interface:

| Dataset       | What it provides                          | Scoring        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **synthetic** | self-contained injected contradictions (offline, deterministic) | substring |
| **HotpotQA**  | multi-hop QA with distractor paragraphs   | substring      |
| **FEVER**     | fact-checking claims plus gold evidence   | label (SUPPORTED/REFUTED/NEI) |

HotpotQA and FEVER download from HuggingFace on first use; synthetic needs no network. Everything else runs on free tools:

| Concern      | Choice                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Embeddings   | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via sentence-transformers (local) |
| Vector store | ChromaDB (local, on disk)                        |
| LLM          | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via Groq (free tier)   |
| UI           | Streamlit                                        |

The only thing that touches the internet is the Groq LLM call. Embeddings are entirely local: no OpenAI, no paid APIs.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows (PowerShell):
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # macOS / Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your free Groq API key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

   Get one at <https://console.groq.com/keys>.

4. Optional: add your own data. Drop real artist `.txt` files into `data/real/` and fake ones into `data/poisoned/`. Example files are already provided so you can see the expected format. If you add questions, edit `questions.py` to match (see the format described in that file).

## Running things

### The interactive UI

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then in the browser:
- pick a data source: the hand-written artist files, or one of the exported benchmark datasets (synthetic / hotpotqa / fever)
- toggle "Include poisoned documents" to add or remove the fake sources
- toggle "Verification mode" to enable the skeptical, contradiction-checking prompt
- ask a question and inspect both the answer and the retrieved sources (poisoned sources are flagged in the UI)

The artist files work out of the box. To make the benchmark datasets selectable, export them to `.txt` first (see below).

### Exporting the datasets for the UI

```bash
python -m src.export_datasets
```

This writes each dataset's items to `data/<dataset>/real/` and `data/<dataset>/poisoned/` (one `.txt` per item), plus a `data/<dataset>/index.csv` listing each `question`, its `gold` answer, and the `poison_answer`. The Streamlit app then reads those folders just like the artist files. First run downloads HotpotQA and FEVER from HuggingFace (synthetic is offline). The app and the exporter run independently: exporting does not run any experiments.

### The experiments (generates the CSV)

```bash
python -m src.evaluator
```

This runs the three experiments over all three datasets (synthetic, HotpotQA, FEVER) and writes:

- `results/experiment_results.csv`: one row per item, with `dataset`, `model`, `top_k`, `is_correct`, `is_hallucinated`, `self_consistency`, and so on.
- `results/experiment_summary.csv`: accuracy / hallucination_rate / self_consistency aggregated per (dataset, experiment, model, top_k).

First run downloads HotpotQA and FEVER from HuggingFace. Defaults are small (10 items/dataset, one model, `top_k=4`, self-consistency off) so it finishes quickly. To scale up or sweep models, retrieval settings, or self-consistency, edit the `Evaluator(...)` call at the bottom of `src/evaluator.py`, e.g.:

```python
Evaluator(
    n_per_dataset=50,
    models=["llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "llama-3.1-8b-instant"],
    top_ks=[2, 4, 8],
    self_consistency_samples=5,   # 0 = off
).run_all()
```

### The charts

Open `notebooks/demo.ipynb` and run all cells to visualise accuracy and hallucination rate per experiment.

## The three experiments

| # | Knowledge base   | Verification prompt | What it shows                           |
| - | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Real docs only   | off                   | Baseline accuracy (no misinformation)    |
| 2 | Real + Poisoned  | off                   | How badly fake docs fool the model       |
| 3 | Real + Poisoned  | on                    | Whether verification reduces the damage  |

Metrics (printed and saved per dataset x experiment x model x top_k):

- **accuracy**: fraction of items answered correctly (substring match for QA datasets; correct SUPPORTED/REFUTED/NEI label for FEVER).
- **hallucination_rate**: fraction of poisoned-target items where the model repeated the fake answer or flipped verdict. The core "did the misinformation win" number.
- **self_consistency** (optional): mean agreement of resampled answers at a non-zero temperature; how reliably the model gives the same answer.

The expected story: hallucination_rate jumps from Exp 1 to Exp 2, then drops again in Exp 3 if verification helps. P5 also asks you to compare these across models and retrieval settings, hence the `models` / `top_ks` sweep.

---
## Tests

Unit tests cover the pure logic that every reported number depends on: poison generation, label parsing, correctness/hallucination scoring, and result aggregation. They need no network calls or API key, so they run in about a second.

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

- `test_poison.py` : the fabricated-answer generator (`fake_answer`, `make_poison_passage`): the lie is never equal to the truth, numbers stay numeric, booleans flip, and the candidate pool never leaks a number into a free-text answer.
- `test_base.py` : label parsing and scoring (`parse_label`, `score_answer`), including the FEVER NEI-first ordering and the "correct and hallucinated at once" edge case discussed in the report.
- `test_synthetic.py` : the offline synthetic adapter: every task is well-formed (poison ≠ gold, the real doc contains the gold value, IDs are unique).
- `test_evaluator_summarize.py` — the aggregation logic: accuracy over all items, hallucination rate over poisoned targets only, groups kept separate per (dataset, experiment, model, top_k).

The retrieval, generation, and dataset-download paths aren't unit-tested because they need a live Groq call or a HuggingFace download; those are exercised end-to-end by running the evaluator.

---
## How it works (quick tour for the report)

1. **Datasets** (`datasets_p5/`) each load into a common `Task` (question/claim, real evidence passages, one fabricated poison passage, gold answer/label). `poison.py` builds the poison: it flips yes/no, perturbs numbers, or swaps in a plausible alternative entity.
2. **Ingestion** (`ingestion.py`) builds a per-item, in-memory ChromaDB collection from that item's passages (plus the poison doc in Exp 2/3), embedding each chunk locally with MiniLM. Real vs poisoned origin is kept in the metadata.
3. **Retrieval** (`retriever.py`) embeds the question and returns the top-k most similar chunks by cosine similarity.
4. **Generation** (`pipeline.py`) stuffs those chunks into a prompt and calls the Groq Llama model. A `verification` flag swaps in a skeptical, contradiction-checking system prompt; a `task_type` of `"label"` switches to the FEVER SUPPORTED/REFUTED/NEI verdict prompt.
5. **Evaluation** (`evaluator.py`) drives every dataset through the three experiments across the model / top-k sweep, scores the answers, optionally measures self-consistency, and writes the CSVs.

## Notes

- The first run downloads the MiniLM embedding model (about 90 MB); afterwards it's cached and works offline.
- Answers in the Streamlit demo are scored by simple, case-insensitive substring matching against the `correct_answer` / `poisoned_answer` strings in `questions.py`. Keep those strings short and distinctive (a year, a city) for reliable scoring.
- `temperature=0.0` is used so results are as reproducible as possible.
